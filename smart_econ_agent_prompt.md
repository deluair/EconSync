## **Comprehensive GitHub Simulation Project: Smart Agent for Applied Economics Research**

### **Project Overview & Motivation**

Develop a sophisticated AI agent system that integrates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) frameworks to revolutionize applied economics research. This system addresses the critical challenge of handling vast, heterogeneous economic datasets while maintaining computational efficiency and interpretability. The agent combines the parameter-efficient fine-tuning capabilities of LoRA, the knowledge grounding of RAG systems, and the autonomous reasoning capabilities of ReAct to create an intelligent research assistant for economic analysis.

**Research Problem**: Modern economic research faces unprecedented data complexity, requiring systems that can process financial data, trade statistics, policy documents, and market indicators while maintaining transparency and accuracy in analytical outputs. Traditional approaches struggle with the computational demands of large language models and the need for real-time, context-aware economic insights.
